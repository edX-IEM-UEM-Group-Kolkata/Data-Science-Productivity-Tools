1. Git and GitHub allow easy version control, collaboration, and resource sharing.

2. 
```
mkdir project-clone
cd project-clone
git clone https://github.com/user123/repo123.git
ls
```

3. ```modified: heights.txt, no changes added to commit```

   This message means that the heights.txt file was modified, but the changes have not been staged or committed to the local repository.


4. git push should be used instead of git pull.

5. 
```
echo “A new repository with my scripts and data” > README.txt
git init
git add README.txt
git commit -m "First commit. Adding README file."
git remote add origin `https://github.com/user123/repo123.git`
git push
